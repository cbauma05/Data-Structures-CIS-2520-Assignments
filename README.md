# Data-Structures-CIS-2520-Assignments
A collection of CIS*2520 Data Structures Assignments involving array-based memory, sorting + searching algorithms, hash-tables, BSTs, Tries, and Graphs

## #1. Hapax Legonema
This tool will tally how many occurrences of each word there are in each data file presented on the command line, but the 
objective is to list the hapax legomena. Each hapax legomenon (the singular form of this term) is a word that
occurs only once in an entire document.

## #2. List Tool Efficiency
This project clearly demonstrates the time complexity difference between various search algorithms with large quantities of data. It loads large quantities of data then based on the user input will process the data in one of 3 methods. Either with a _dynammic array_, _Generic LinkedList_, or a _LinkedList with a tail reference_.
The amount of files processed, processing time, and amount of memory used for the dynamic array are displayed to the user.
